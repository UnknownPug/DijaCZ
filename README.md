<a name="projGoal"><h2>Project goal</h2></a>

üîò The goal of the project was to get familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript languages, learn how to use libraries, API. explore how to create a website on the Front End side.

üîò Dija.cz was made to make it easier for people to work with documents by storing them on this website and thus interacting with them online.

<a name="proc"><h2>Process</h2></a>

üîò The development process consists of 3 parts: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript. If the item is marked as "‚ö†Ô∏è", it means that the item was not done for a specific reason, which will be explained.

üîò This description of the process is directly linked to the project evaluation table, which you can find [by clicking here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18rSiofsqOHGTXj_Zbs1s-rtB2URXG4iUmxn_5JtwWDY/edit#gid=0)

#### HTML
‚úÖ Validity - Valid use of HTML5 doctype (https://validator.w3.org)

‚úÖ Validity - Functioning in modern browsers in the latest development versions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera)

‚úÖ Semantic tags - Correct use of semantic tags (section, article, nav, aside, ...)

‚úÖ Graphics - SVG / Canvas

‚úÖ Media - Audio/Video

‚úÖ Form elements - Wildcard, autofocus

‚ö†Ô∏è Offline application - Using the possibility of the site functioning without Internet connection
   - Explanation: The application cannot be used offline, as there is a need to connect to the network to create new documents and save them. Also, there will be no access to the radio, as there is a need to be connected to the network to play it.

#### CSS
‚úÖ Advanced selectors - Use of advanced pseudo-classes and combinators

‚úÖ Vendor prefixes

‚úÖ CSS3 2D/3D transformations

‚úÖ CSS3 transitions/animations

‚úÖ Media queries - The site works on mobile devices and others (i.e. it doesn't crash)

#### JavaScript
‚úÖ OOP usage - Prototype inheritance, its use, namespaces

‚ö†Ô∏è Using a JS framework or library - Use and understanding of jQuery, React, Vue
   - Explanation: Using a JavaScript framework or library like jQuery, React, or Vue might not be a good choice for this code because it is relatively simple and does not require the additional complexity, learning curve, performance overhead, dependency management, and increased file size that comes with using a framework or library. It's better to keep the code lean and minimize dependencies.

‚úÖ Using advanced JS APIs - Use of advanced APIs (File API, Drag & Drop, LocalStorage)

‚úÖ Functional history - Scrolling with back/forward buttons of the browser - if it follows from the functionatilty (History API)

‚úÖ Media control - Use Media API (video, audio), playback from JS

‚ö†Ô∏è Offline application - Use of JS API for status discovery
   - Explanation: The provided code doesn't require the use of a JavaScript API for status discovery. It primarily focuses on managing document cards and performing actions such as adding, deleting, and updating their data.

‚ö†Ô∏è JS work with SVG - events, creation, editing.
   - Explanation: There are no events, creations, or edits in this project that require the use of JavaScript with SVG.
